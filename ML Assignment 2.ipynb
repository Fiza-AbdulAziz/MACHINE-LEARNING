    "61.What is the Curse of Dimensionality, and How Does It Affect Machine Learning Algorithms?\n",
    "The curse of dimensionality refers to the challenges that arise when working with high-dimensional data. As the number of features (dimensions) increases, the data becomes sparse, and models struggle to generalize. Distance measures like Euclidean distance become less meaningful, affecting algorithms like KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "62.What is Feature Scaling, and Why Is It Important in Machine Learning?\n",
    "Feature scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the model. It is essential because many machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, KNN, and gradient-based methods, are sensitive to the scale of the features. Common methods include Min-Max Scaling and Standardization.\n",
    "\n",
    "63.How Does the Naïve Bayes Algorithm Handle Categorical Features?\n",
    "Naïve Bayes assumes that categorical features are conditionally independent given the class. It calculates the likelihood of each feature belonging to a class and multiplies these probabilities together.\n",
    "\n",
    "64.Explain the Concept of Prior and Posterior Probabilities in Naïve Bayes\n",
    "Prior Probability: The probability of a class before observing any data (i.e., \n",
    "P(Class)).\n",
    "Posterior Probability: The updated probability of a class after observing the data, calculated using Bayes' theorem \n",
    "P(Class∣Data).\n",
    "\n",
    "65.What is Laplace Smoothing, and Why Is It Used in Naïve Bayes?\n",
    "Laplace smoothing (or additive smoothing) adds a small constant (typically 1) to each count to avoid zero probabilities in Naïve Bayes when a feature has never been observed in a class. It ensures that no probability is exactly zero, making the model more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. Can Naïve Bayes Handle Continuous Features?\n",
    "Yes, continuous features are typically handled using Gaussian Naïve Bayes, which assumes that the continuous data follows a normal distribution. For each feature, the mean and variance are calculated for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "67. What Are the Assumptions of the Naïve Bayes Algorithm?\n",
    "All features are conditionally independent given the class label.\n",
    "The presence of one feature does not affect the presence of another feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. How Does Naïve Bayes Handle Missing Values?\n",
    "Naïve Bayes can handle missing values by ignoring the missing feature when calculating probabilities and only considering the available features.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. What Are Some Common Applications of Naïve Bayes?\n",
    "Spam filtering: Classifies emails as spam or not.\n",
    "Sentiment analysis: Determines the sentiment of a text.\n",
    "Document classification: Categorizes documents based on their content.\n",
    "Medical diagnosis: Predicts the likelihood of diseases.\n",

    "70. Explain the Difference Between Generative and Discriminative Models\n",
    "Generative Models: Model the joint probability distribution \n",
    "P(X,Y), allowing for the generation of data. (e.g., Naïve Bayes)\n",
    "Discriminative Models: Model the conditional probability \n",
    "P(Y∣X), focusing on the decision boundary between classes. (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "71. How Does the Decision Boundary of a Naïve Bayes Classifier Look Like for Binary Classification Tasks?\n",
    "For binary classification, Naïve Bayes assumes that the features are independent, so the decision boundary is typically linear. It separates the feature space based on the maximum posterior probability for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "72.What is the Difference Between Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Gaussian Naïve Bayes?\n",
    "Multinomial Naïve Bayes: Used for discrete data like word counts in a document. It's typically applied to text classification problems (e.g., spam filtering).\n",
    "Gaussian Naïve Bayes: Used for continuous data, assuming that the features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. It’s applied in cases like medical diagnosis with continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "73.How Does Naïve Bayes Handle Numerical Instability Issues?\n",
    "Naïve Bayes can face numerical instability when multiplying small probabilities, which can result in underflow. To avoid this, the logarithm of probabilities is often used, converting multiplication of probabilities into summation.\n",
    "\n",
    "74.What is the Laplacian Correction, and When Is It Used in Naïve Bayes?\n",
    "Laplacian correction (or Laplace smoothing) adds a small constant (usually 1) to each feature count to handle zero-frequency issues, where certain features may not appear in the training set for a particular class. This avoids the model assigning zero probability to unseen features during prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "75.Can Naïve Bayes Be Used for Regression Tasks?\n",
    "Naïve Bayes is not commonly used for regression because it is primarily a classification algorithm. However, modifications of Naïve Bayes for regression (e.g., Gaussian Naïve Bayes) can predict continuous outcomes, but this is less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "76.Explain the Concept of Conditional Independence Assumption in Naïve Bayes\n",
    "Naïve Bayes assumes that all features are conditionally independent given the class label. This means that the presence of a particular feature does not affect the presence of any other feature, which simplifies computation but may not always hold true in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "77. How Does Naïve Bayes Handle Categorical Features with a Large Number of Categories?\n",
    "Naïve Bayes can handle categorical features with a large number of categories by calculating the conditional probability for each category separately. However, with many categories, it may require large amounts of data to estimate these probabilities accurately. Laplace smoothing can help in cases with sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "78. What Are Some Drawbacks of the Naïve Bayes Algorithm?\n",
    "Independence Assumption: The assumption that features are independent may not hold true in many real-world scenarios.\n",
    "Zero Probability: If a categorical feature has no representation in the training set, it leads to zero probability. This can be mitigated by Laplace smoothing.\n",
    "Limited Expressiveness: Naïve Bayes uses simple linear decision boundaries, making it less effective for complex, non-linear problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "79. Explain the Concept of Smoothing in Naïve Bayes\n",
    "Smoothing in Naïve Bayes, like Laplace smoothing, involves adding a small constant to each feature count to handle cases where certain feature-class combinations do not occur in the training data. This helps avoid zero probabilities and improves the robustness of the model, especially with small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "80. How Does Naïve Bayes Handle Imbalanced Datasets?\n",
    "Naïve Bayes can struggle with imbalanced datasets because it calculates probabilities based on the overall frequencies of classes in the training data. To mitigate this, techniques such as class weighting (giving more importance to the minority class) or resampling (oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class) can be applied.\n",
